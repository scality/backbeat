# Design

## CONSIDERATIONS

### Containerized

Lives in its own container.

### Distributed

 There will be multiple instances per site for HA. If one of the instances
 dies, the queue replica from another instance can be used to process the
 records.

### Extensions

The core engine can be extended to achieve features like asynchronous
replication.

### Backend agnostic

All interactions will go through S3. This way it is not restricted to one
backend and we can reuse existing solutions for different backends.

### Background Jobs

Backbeat will include a background tasks which runs on a crontab schedule.

### Multi-threaded

Using Kafka's KeyedMessage mechanism, multiple consumers can process entries in
parallel achieving high throughput.

## DESIGN OVERVIEW

![design](/res/design-overview.png)

### DEPLOYMENT (Mono/Multi-site)

The nodes of a Backbeat cluster must live within one given datacenter. Ideally
there will be one standalone cluster per site. Each cluster will have multiple
instances for HA.

Backbeat will be the backbone of features like asynchronous replication which
rely on such local services to perform remote actions. The basis of replication
relies on versioning, Metadata and Data propagation from site to site, which
does not need the message queue to be shared between sites (and we don’t want
that either because the internals of Backbeat are not necessarily geo-aware.

### KAFKA

Kafka is used as a queue manager for Backbeat.

#### PROS

* Distributed, Pub/Sub, Simple to use, durable replicated log.
* Fast reads and writes using sequential reads/writes to disk.
* Topics contain partitions which are strictly ordered.
* Replication is done on partition level and can be controlled per partition.
* More than one consumer can process a partition achieving parallel processing.
* Can have one consumer processing real time and other consumer processing in
    batch.
* Easy to add a large number of consumers without affecting performance.
* We can leverage stream processing for encryption, compression etc.

#### CONS

* Uses Zookeeper but it’s not in the critical path
* Needs optimization for fault tolerance
* Not designed for high latency environments

## APPLYING BACKBEAT

### USING BACKBEAT FOR ASYNC REPLICATION

![crr](res/backbeat-crr.png)

For asynchronous replication, we can use Backbeat to replicate the
objects from a bucket of one region to the other. The design
highlights how this feature can be achieved by using Backbeat.
Reference: AWS rules of what is and what is not replicated
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/crr-what-is-isnot-replicated.html

Note: For Active/Passive setup, the target will be READONLY. This would mean
that in a Disaster Recovery setup for a customer, if the customer loses site A
they can point themselves to site B to perform READONLY actions until site A
comes back up. Although they could write to site B these writes will not be
replicated to site A (one of the many reasons being site A may have data that
hasn't been fully replicated to site B when the failure occurred).

* All replication actions go through S3. S3 exposes routes for
    Metadata and Data backends to Backbeat.

* MetaData journal is used as the source of truth.

* Object metadata will have a new property, `replicationStatus`. When a CRR
    configuration is enabled on a bucket, any S3's PUT metadata operations on
    objects matching the configuration will have `replicationStatus` as
    `PENDING`.

* A producer (background job) wakes up, let’s say every `n` seconds, requests
    journal from Metadata starting from a sequenceId. The producer then queues
    entries from the journal which have `replicationStatus` PENDING into Kafka.

* The entries contain the sequence number as key and a stringified json with
    fields like action (PUT), object key, object metadata.

* Backbeat will leverage Kafka's KeyedMessage mechanism, which guarantees all
    records with the same key, lets say `<bucket name>:<object key>` are written
    into the same partition and ordering of records is guaranteed within a
    partition. This gives the advantage of the ability to balance records across
    all the Kafka nodes and the assignment of multiple consumers to process the
    queue.

* A consumer picks up from the last committed offset and processes one entry
    at a time. The consumer first copies data to the target site, updates the
    object's metadata with the new location, sets the replicationStatus to
    `REPLICA` and writes the metadata entry at the target. Once the metadata
    and data operations are completed on the target bucket, the object's
    metadata in source bucket is updated to reflect replicationStatus as
    `COMPLETED`.

* If there has been any failure in these sequence of operations for an entry
    then the object metadata on the source is updated with replicationStatus
    `FAILED`. The consumer will commit the offset of the last successful entry
    processed to Kafka. On the next run, this entry is tried again.

## SECURITY

* End to End SSL - Use PKI certificates with TLS for trusted communication
    between the servers.
    On all the sites(SF, NY, Paris for example), communication occurs
    through a private route by establishing a TCP connection using the PKI
    certificates.

* Temporary credentials - Backbeat will have no credentials (access key,
    secret key pair) by default and will acquire temporary credentials from IAM
    to perform actions on users' resources.

* A trust policy (IAM actions) will be created allowing the user to assume the
    role to gain temporary credentials to the source/destination accounts’
    resources.

* Cross account permissions can be managed using ACLs.
    Access policies (S3 actions) will be created allowing the role to perform
    specific actions to achieve replication actions.
    Backbeat first requests temporary credentials from IAM after establishing a
    trusted communication connection using the certificates.
    Temporary credentials expire every hour(or some set time). These
    credentials will be used to communicate with S3 for performing replication
    actions.

* Credentials are renewed when they expire.
    Temporary credentials don’t span across the sites, so Backbeat has to renew
    credentials on all the sites individually.

* The setup and behavior will be inline with AWS' specifications for
    asynchronous replication. Benefits are that we don't
    hardcode any credentials in Backbeat and roles, policies are transparent to
    the customer who can see what actions we are using for replication.
    Customers are not expected to maintain or alter these policies,
    they will be managed by Scality at deploy time.

## OSS LICENSES

* Kafka and Zookeeper are the only dependencies of Backbeat which are licensed
    under Apache License 2.0.
* `node-rdkafka` yarn module which is be used for the
    producer/consumer actions and maintained by Blizzard Entertainment
    is licensed under the MIT license.

## STATISTICS FOR SLA, METRICS etc

There are two ways we can approach this.
Pub/Sub events can be used in addition to the MetaData log in a separate topic
(let’s call it statistics). The records in this topic can be leveraged by
comparing to the active queue to generate statistics like

- RPO (Recovery Point Objective)
- RTO(Recovery Time Objective)
- Storage backlog in bytes
- Storage replicated so far in bytes
- Number of objects in backlog
- Number of objects replicated so far etc.

Use a decoupled topic in addition to the queue topic. This will be managed by
the producers/consumers adding records for non-replicated and replicated
entries. Since each entry would have a sequence number, calculating the
difference between the sequence numbers of the latest non-replicated and
replicated records would give us the required statistics.

## WRITING EXTENSIONS

A backbeat extension allows to add more functionality to the core
backbeat asynchronous processor. E.g. Asynchronous Replication is one
of the extensions available for backbeat.

Extensions are located in the extensions/ directory, with a
sub-directory named after the extension name (lowercase).

### Extending the Queue Populator

The queue populator is a core backbeat process which reads entries
from the metadata log periodically and provides them to all running
extensions through the filter() method, while maintaining the
offsets of the latest processed log entries.

Extensions can publish messages to one or more kafka topics on
reception of particular log entry events.

To achieve this, in the extension module directory, create an
'index.js' file exporting the attributes defining the extension
metadata and entrypoints, e.g. to create a "mycoolext" extension, put
in extensions/mycoolext/index.js:

```
module.exports = {
    name: 'my cool extension',
    version: '1.0.0',
    queuePopulatorExtension: require('./MyCoolExtensionPopulator.js'),
};
```

Here, MyCoolExtensionPopulator.js exports a class that:

- inherits from lib/queuePopulator/QueuePopulatorExtension class

- implements the filter() method, which gets called whenever new
  metadata log entries are fetched, with an "entry" argument
  containing the fields: { bucket, key, type=(put|del), value }

- calls QueuePopulatorExtension.publish() method from the filter()
  method to schedule queueing of kafka entries to topics.

Extensions are enabled based on config.json having a sub-section in
"extensions" matching the name of the extension directory.

E.g. this config.json enables mycoolext extension, and provides
configuration param someparam as "somevalue" to extension classes.

```
{
    [...]
    "extensions": {
        "mycoolext": {
            "someparam": "somevalue"
        }
    }
}
```

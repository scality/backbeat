## OVERVIEW

Backbeat is an engine with a messaging system at its heart.
It's part of Zenko, [Scality](http://www.scality.com/)â€™s
Open Source Multi-Cloud Data Controller.
Learn more about Zenko at [Zenko.io](http://www.zenko.io/)

Backbeat is optimised for queuing metadata update and dispatching work
to long running tasls in the background.
The core engine can be extended for many use cases,
which are called extentions as listed below.

## EXTENSIONS

### Asynchronous Replication

    This feature replicates objects from one S3 bucket to
    another S3 bucket in a different geological region. The extension uses
    Metadata journal as the source of truth and replicates object updates in a
    FIFO order.
